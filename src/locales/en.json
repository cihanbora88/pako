Pako performs restaurant delivery and aims to bring restaurants and cyclists together and enable a transparent and fair delivery system for both sides. Unlike traditional courier platforms, Pako works with a \"bossless\" structure and positions bicycle couriers not as workers, but as partners and independent service providers of the platform. It cares about locality, neighborhood and mutual trust. It says that a sustainable and nature-friendly transportation model that does not prioritize profit and acts with collective wisdom is possible, and believes that the bicycle can be the carrier of this model; it offers a fast and ethical delivery alternative with its logistics network that reduces the carbon footprint to zero.",

What we carry in Pako is not just packages, but a common culture. Pako works with the understanding of \"festina lante\" (hurry up but slowly) by adapting to the rhythm of the city; thus establishing stability that gives confidence to both businesses and the field. An approach that prepares the individual for the changes of life, teaches him economy from the core and trains his cognitive abilities as an entrepreneurship school is in Pako's nature. This form of existence makes our job a bit different from others.",
    "communityDesc2": "Pako is not for everyone; it is suitable for adventure lovers and nature people, but not for those who get away with things easily. In these contexts, the Pako rider is positioned outside the mainstream."
